# Vector-Quantization-by-LBG
Scientific Computing Project 1

LBG algorithm is like a K-means clustering algorithm which takes a set of input vectors <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=S = \{x_i \in R^d| i = 1, 2, \dots , n\}">  

as input and generates a representative subset of vectors $C = \{c_j \in R^d| j = 1, 2, \dots , K\}$ with a user specified $K << n$ as output according to the similarity measure. For the application of Vector Quantization (VQ), $d = 16$, $K = 256$ or $512$ are commonly used.
