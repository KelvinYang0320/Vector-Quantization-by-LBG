# Vector-Quantization-by-LBG
Scientific Computing Project 1

LBG algorithm is like a K-means clustering algorithm which takes a set of input vectors *S* 
as input and generates a representative subset of vectors *C* with a user specified *K << n* as output according to the similarity measure. For the application of Vector Quantization (VQ), *d* = 16, *K* = 256 or 512 are commonly used.
